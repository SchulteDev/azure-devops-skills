# Pull request validation builds

Never claim a trigger is broken — in chat or on the PR — before working through rule 3.

# Tools

- `repo_pull_request` (action `get`): `mergeStatus`, `lastMergeSourceCommit`, `targetRefName`.
- `pipelines_build` (action `get_status`).
- The MCP server has no policy tool: use `az repos pr policy list` and `az repos policy list`.

# Rules

## 1. PR builds run on the merge ref

- PR builds have `sourceBranch` `refs/pull/<prId>/merge`, never `refs/heads/<branch>`. Filter listings with `--branch refs/pull/<prId>/merge`.
- The merge ref is recomputed when the PR changes, not when the target moves. Compare a run's `sourceVersion` with the PR's current merge commit.

## 2. Find the build for a push

- `az repos pr policy list --id <prId>`: the Build policy's `context.buildId` shows the build immediately and whether it is required.
- Build listings lag the queue by up to minutes.
- Match the build's `sourceVersion` to the pushed commit.
- `az pipelines runs list --top 1` without a branch filter can return an unrelated run.

## 3. No build at all

Check in order:

1. `mergeStatus` `conflicts` (`2`): no build and no error. Resolve the conflict and push.
2. No build validation policy on the target branch (e.g. a stacked PR): no build; `pr:` triggers don't apply. Say in the PR that it is unvalidated.

## 4. Branch policies

- Check policies per branch; the YAML `trigger:` list says nothing about them: `az repos policy list --repository-id <id> --branch <branch> --query "[].{name:type.displayName, enabled:isEnabled, blocking:isBlocking}" -o json` (`-o table` drops the name).
- Don't diff two policy listings to claim a policy changed; they vary spuriously.
- `az devops invoke --area policy --resource configurations` needs `--api-version 7.1-preview`.
